    Move extra istio revision out of main test (#22336)

    * Move extra istio revision out of main test

    This applies istio inside of the revision test, instead of for every
    pilot test. This gives us more flexibility. The reason this wasn't done
    before is the cleanup was broken

    * wip

    * fix build

    * Save during apply

    * Fix nil
